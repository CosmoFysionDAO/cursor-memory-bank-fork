# Creative Analyze — Architecture & R&D Focus

Analyze the project's current architecture and documentation. Propose a creative, high-level design or optimization for the current task that standard patterns might miss. Focus on R&D and scalability.

If the project uses Memory Bank: you may read `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/tasks.md` for context, and optionally write design notes to `memory-bank/creative/` or reference `.cursor/templates/adr_template.md` / `rnd_template.md` if the output is an ADR or R&D comparison.
