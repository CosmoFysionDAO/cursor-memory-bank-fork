# Debrief — Memory Bank Sync

Update the Memory Bank. Sync progress.md, activeContext.md, and decisionLog.md based on the latest work to maintain context persistence.

1. **progress.md** — Add a short description of work completed since last sync (or since task start). Use `git diff` or changed files if available.
2. **activeContext.md** — Adjust or narrow the current focus for the next step; do not fully reset unless the task is archived.
3. **decisionLog.md** — Append any new ADR references from `memory-bank/decisions/` (date, file name, one-line summary). Create `memory-bank/decisionLog.md` if it does not exist.

All paths are under `memory-bank/` at the project root.
